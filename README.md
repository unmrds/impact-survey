This repository is the space for collaborative development of the University of New Mexico's (UNM) Research Data Services (RDS) Impact Survey instrument that is used across RDS services to collect feedback targeted at improving RDS services in supporting research data management knowledge, skills, and abilities at UNM. 

The current version of the impact survey is hosted in SurveyMonkey (https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/RDS_survey_demo) and a static PDF version can be downloaded from this repository (https://github.com/unmrds/impact-survey/raw/main/RDS_impact_survey-SurveyMonkey_version.pdf).
